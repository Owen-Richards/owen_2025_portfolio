# ü§ñ Multi-Agent Development Workflow

## Overview

This portfolio is designed for collaborative development with multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel on different aspects of the project.

## Agent Specializations

### üé® Design Agent
**GitHub Issue**: [#1](https://github.com/Owen-Richards/owen_2025_portfolio/issues/1)

**Responsibilities:**
- Visual design system refinement
- Color palette optimization
- Typography improvements
- Animation polish
- Accessibility enhancements

**Key Files:**
- `tailwind.config.js` - Design tokens and color system
- `src/app/globals.css` - Global styles and utilities
- `src/components/sections/` - Component visual implementations

**Copilot Prompts:**
```
// Use existing design system to enhance visual components
// Focus on 2025 design trends: multi-tonal colors, bold typography, anti-design
// Maintain accessibility and performance while improving aesthetics
```

### ‚ö° Performance Agent  
**GitHub Issue**: [#2](https://github.com/Owen-Richards/owen_2025_portfolio/issues/2)

**Responsibilities:**
- Bundle size optimization
- Core Web Vitals improvements
- 3D performance tuning
- Loading state implementations
- Code splitting enhancements

**Key Files:**
- `next.config.ts` - Build optimization
- `src/components/3d/` - Three.js performance
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- Package.json - Dependency optimization

**Copilot Prompts:**
```
// Optimize performance without sacrificing visual quality
// Focus on 60fps animations and fast loading times
// Implement progressive loading for 3D elements
```

### üìù Content Agent
**GitHub Issue**: [#3](https://github.com/Owen-Richards/owen_2025_portfolio/issues/3)

**Responsibilities:**
- Blog post creation
- Project case studies
- About page content
- SEO optimization
- Resume enhancement

**Key Files:**
- `src/content/blog/` - Blog posts in MDX
- `src/content/projects/` - Project case studies
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - About page content

**Copilot Prompts:**
```
// Create engaging technical content that showcases expertise
// Use MDX format with proper frontmatter
// Focus on SEO and readability
```

### üöÄ Features Agent
**GitHub Issue**: [#4](https://github.com/Owen-Richards/owen_2025_portfolio/issues/4)

**Responsibilities:**
- Advanced 3D implementations
- Interactive features
- Contact form integration
- Dark mode toggle
- PWA features

**Key Files:**
- `src/components/3d/` - Advanced 3D scenes
- `src/components/ui/` - Interactive UI components
- `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Contact functionality

**Copilot Prompts:**
```
// Implement cutting-edge web features
// Focus on technical demonstration and user experience
// Maintain compatibility and performance
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Each agent works on feature branches
git checkout -b design/visual-system-v2
git checkout -b performance/bundle-optimization
git checkout -b content/blog-posts
git checkout -b features/advanced-3d
```

### 2. Collaboration Rules
- **No conflicts**: Each agent focuses on their specialized files
- **Communication**: Use GitHub issues for coordination
- **Testing**: All changes must maintain existing functionality
- **Performance**: Keep Lighthouse scores above 90

### 3. GitHub Copilot Usage
Each agent should:
1. Read the existing codebase context
2. Use the specialized prompts from `COPILOT_PROMPTS.md`
3. Maintain consistency with established patterns
4. Document changes and improvements

## GitHub Codespaces Setup

### For Remote Development
```bash
# Open in Codespace
# All agents can work simultaneously in different Codespaces
# Environment is pre-configured with all dependencies
```

### Environment Variables
Set these in your Codespace secrets:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_API_KEY` (when implementing contact form)

## Deployment Strategy

### Automatic Deployment
- **Main branch**: Auto-deploys to production via Vercel
- **Feature branches**: Preview deployments for testing
- **Pull requests**: Automatic preview URLs

### Quality Gates
Before merging to main:
1. TypeScript compilation passes
2. ESLint checks pass
3. Performance tests pass
4. Visual regression tests pass

## Communication Channels

### GitHub Issues
- Use issue templates for consistent communication
- Tag issues with agent specialization labels
- Reference related issues in PRs

### Pull Request Process
1. **Draft PR**: Early collaboration and feedback
2. **Review**: Cross-agent code review
3. **Testing**: Automated and manual testing
4. **Merge**: Squash and merge to main
