# Legacy Copilot Cleanup Prompts

Use these prompts in Copilot Chat (or inline) to accelerate the cleanup of the portfolio codebase.
Each entry includes the main files to open before asking Copilot so the assistant has all necessary
context.

## Theme & Styling

### 1. Extract Theme Tokens

**Open files**: `src/components/ui/useThemeStyles.ts`, `src/styles/theme/` (new)

Prompt:

```
Refactor `useThemeStyles` to consume static theme tokens from a new `src/styles/theme/tokens.ts` module. Define shared spacing, typography, and button variants there, export a helper `getThemeTokens(themeMode)`, and memoize the hook so we stop rebuilding 100+ strings on every render.
```

### 2. Trim Unused Style Buckets

**Open file**: `src/components/ui/useThemeStyles.ts`

Prompt:

```
Remove unused style groups (nav/form/animation/effects) from `useThemeStyles`, and ensure only the tokens referenced by components remain. Update imports where necessary to use shared Tailwind utility classes instead of the removed tokens.
```

### 3. Simplify Global CSS

**Open files**: `src/app/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`

Prompt:

```
Reduce `globals.css` to foundational resets and CSS variables, moving repeated spacing/typography definitions into Tailwind `theme.extend`. Add component classes (glass-card, section-shell, etc.) via `@layer components` rather than ad-hoc selectors.
```

### 4. Clean Tailwind Plugin Loader

**Open file**: `tailwind.config.js`

Prompt:

```
Remove the async `loadPlugins()` pattern and import `@tailwindcss/forms` and `@tailwindcss/typography` directly in the config. Ensure the config still exports synchronously and update any missing plugin registrations.
```

## Architecture & Data

### 5. Modularize Navigation

**Open files**: `src/components/ui/NavigationEnhanced.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Split `NavigationEnhanced` into smaller units: move the navigation item array into `src/constants/navigation.ts`, extract `NavigationButton` and `MobileNavigationItem` to `src/components/navigation/` with their props typed, and introduce a `useActiveSection` hook under `src/hooks/`. Keep the exported top-level component lightweight.
```

### 6. Guard Theme Persistence

**Open files**: `src/components/ui/ThemeProvider.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Wrap all `localStorage` reads/writes in effect hooks that check for `window`. Provide a fallback theme from `matchMedia`, surface an `isReady` flag, and render children only after hydration to eliminate flicker.
```

### 7. Sandboxing Scroll Manager

**Open files**: `src/lib/scroll/scroll.ts`, `src/components/ui/ScrollWrapper.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Refactor `ScrollManager` so GSAP, Lenis, and MutationObserver initialization happens inside an explicit `init()` called from `useEffect`. Ensure `ScrollWrapper` calls `scrollManager.init()` on mount and `destroy()` on unmount to prevent duplicate cursors.
```

### 8. Extract Feature Content

**Open files**: `src/components/sections/ProjectsEnhanced.tsx`,
`src/components/sections/EnhancedHeroSection.tsx`, `src/components/sections/SkillsMatrix.tsx`,
`src/components/sections/HighlightsSection.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Move all static data arrays (projects, hero badges, skills, highlights) into typed modules under `src/content/`. Adjust each section component to import the data and accept it as props to shrink client bundles.
```

### 9. Lazy-load 3D Hero

**Open files**: `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/3d/Hero3D.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Convert the Home page to load `Hero3D` with `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })`, render a lightweight placeholder until the component mounts, and gate rendering by IntersectionObserver so the Three.js canvas does not hurt LCP.
```

## Tooling & Quality

### 10. Shared Utility for `cn`

**Open files**: `src/components/ui/useThemeStyles.ts`, `src/utils/cn.ts` (new)

Prompt:

```
Create a reusable `cn` helper in `src/utils/cn.ts` that wraps `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`. Replace local implementations (like the one inside `useThemeStyles`) with this shared import to keep class merging consistent.
```

### 11. Testing Harness Setup

**Open files**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/test/setup.ts` (new)

Prompt:

```
Add Vitest + Testing Library configuration. Create a `src/test/setup.ts` that registers Jest DOM matchers, update `package.json` with `test` and `test:watch` scripts, and ensure React testing environment is ready for hooks and components.
```

### 12. Playwright Smoke Flow

**Open files**: `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts` (new), `tests/e2e/` (new)

Prompt:

```
Introduce Playwright for end-to-end smoke tests that verify navigation, scroll progress, and 3D toggle behaviour. Add scripts to `package.json` and scaffold a `tests/e2e/home.spec.ts` covering the main interactions.
```

### 13. Strengthen TypeScript Config

**Open file**: `tsconfig.json`

Prompt:

```
Disable `allowJs`, remove unused compiler options, and add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` plus path aliases for new folders: `@/content`, `@/hooks`, `@/config`. Update includes/excludes accordingly.
```

### 14. Centralize SEO Metadata

**Open files**: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/work/page.tsx`, `src/app/blog/page.tsx`,
`src/app/contact/page.tsx`

Prompt:

```
Create `src/config/seo.ts` exporting canonical metadata objects. Update each route to import from there instead of duplicating the titles/descriptions, and add helper types to ensure keys stay consistent.
```

## Documentation

### 15. Architecture Overview Doc

**Open file**: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`

Prompt:

```
Update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` with sections for feature modules, shared UI, theming, and motion systems. Reference the new folder structure and testing strategy so future contributors understand the architecture.
```
